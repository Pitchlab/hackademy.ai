# Hackademy.ai
This is the github for the first Hackademy. It will (soon!) hold the information you need to get rolling with the Hackademies, and all kinds of extra info. Also look in the repo to find instructions and code specific to hackademies. 

## About Hackademy
We created Hackademy.ai because we're enthusiastic about AI, Machine Learning, and everything around it, and, as long time developers ourselves, wanted to get our hands dirty. And we expect there are a lot more of you out there that know how to build apps, games, websites, database systems, and whatnot, that would like to dive into AI. Besides, while you can do a lot online, it's a lot more fun and more inspiring to do it together, right? 

At Hackademy, we're first launching our Hackathons. Short, fun events that will center around exploring a practical AI/ML theme. Think facial recognition, stock market prediction, voice, chatbots, text scraping, etc. And right now, we're launching the first Hackathon! 

## The first Hackathon
The first Hackademy.ai Hackathon is going to take place the 20th of July, in Amsterdam. The theme will be Voice Recognition, and we'll base it around Google's AIY Voice Kit. Expect a couple of hours of building and playing around with that, topped off with a bit of Tensorflow added in for good measure.  

Some details:

```

## Applying
The first Hackathon has a small setting of 15 people. We really want to make it worthwhile, and we really want to give everyone that participates a good experience. There is a lot of interest for this event. That's why, rather than opening up the meetup floodgates right away, we want to ask you to fill out a short typeform so we can make sure we get a good selection of skills at the table. We'll invite 15 people from those of you that apply, and we'll put 15 more on the waiting list.  

Rest assured: in future hackathons we prefer not to use this system, so if we can't invite you this time, we really want to invite you the next time!
