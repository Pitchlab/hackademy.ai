# Hackathon Setup 

## Install Python 3

We'll be using Python 3. 

* [Install Guide](https://docs.python-guide.org/)
* [Mac OSX](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/) 
* [Windows](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/win/) 
* [Windows](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/) 

Use `python --version` to check your version. Python 2 is different syntactically from Python 3. We'll use 3.

## Install Pip (Python package manager) 

* Pip (python 3) 
* [Packages: PyPi.org](https://pypi.org/) 

If you’re using Python 3.4 (or greater), then PIP comes installed with Python by default. If you’re using an older version of Python, you’ll need to use the installation steps below. Otherwise, skip to the bottom to learn how to start using PIP. 

Use `pip -h` to check if it's there 

To install `sudo easy_install pip` or `sudo apt-get install pip`

## Tensorflow 
In the hackathons we also have a goal of doing actual Machine Learning. To do that we'll use Tensorflow. 

### Python
[Install Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) 

### Tensorflow.js 
[Install Tensorflow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/) 

### Tensorboard 
Visualization for tensorflow. This helps a lot when training networks.
